            <b>No Show & Cancellation Policy:</b><br>
            My Appointments are my livelihood.
            I schedule a limited number of dogs per day and if you don't honor your appointment time, it affects my
            ability
            to support my family.
            Clients must give 24 hour notice to cancel an appointment
            so that it may be made available to others.<br>
            ​
            <b>Late cancellation:</b><br>
            Is defined as any cancellation or reschedule made with less than 24 hours’ notice. Canceling/Rescheduling in
            this manner will result in a 50% of groom fee per pet. The client will be required to pre-pay the full price
            of
            the appointment plus the "No Show" fee at the time of scheduling. This pre-paid amount is non-refundable and
            nontransferable. Repeated late canceling/rescheduling can result in being placed on the “Do Not Serve” list
            and
            future appointments can be denied.
            All future appointments will be required to be pre-paid at time of booking to be booked in, this does not
            include extra fees.<br>

            <b>No-Show:</b><br>
            Is defined as a missed appointment without canceling in any manner. Canceling in this manner will result in
            a
            50% of groom fee per pet. The client will be required to pre-pay the full price of the appointment plus the
            "No
            Show" fee at the time of scheduling. This pre-paid amount is non-refundable and nontransferable. Repeatedly
            missing appointments in this manner can result in being placed on the “Do Not Serve” list and future
            appointments can be denied. All future appointments will be required to be pre-paid at time of booking to be
            booked in, this does not include extra fees. Please Respect The Time Of Other Customers<br>

            <b>Be on Time:</b><br>
            If your pet arrives 10 minutes or more late to the appointment
            it is subject to cancel and will be marked as a "No-Show",
            as I am appointment only and I need to run on time for all clients .<br>
            ​
            <b>Pick Up Time:</b><br>
            Please pick up pets no later than 20 minutes after I have called/messaged to inform you that your pet is
            ready
            to go home, Fee’s will be applied after the 20 min.
            $10 Fee will be charged if late and an additional $1 for every minute increment there after per dog.
        </P>
